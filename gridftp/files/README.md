This directory contains the following files will have been generated by the xenon-gridftp-ca docker images:

* `globus-simple-*_all.deb`, contains public key of ca
* `ca-certifcates/`, contains public key of ca, use as X509_CERT_DIR
* `hosts/<hostname>/`, contains key pair of `<hostname>`
* `users/<username>/`, contains key pair of `<username>`, dn of user is `/O=eScienceCenter/OU=local/CN=<username>`, use as X509_USER_DIR
* `simple-ca/`, the ca itself

The public ca should be installed on all gridftp servers and clients.
The host key pairs should be installled on the gridftp servers.
Each user should have a mapping in `/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile` on each gridftp server.


### Client side installation

To install the certificates at the client side: 

mkdir $HOME/.globus
cp ./users/xenon/* $HOME/.globus
cp -r ./ca-certificates $HOME/.globus/certificates

Gridftp is very picky about hostname resolving so gridftp servers and clients should all be able to resolve fully qualified hostnames of each other.
